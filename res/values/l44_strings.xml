<string name="l44_GameDetail">The shaman reacts (as soon as he recognizes the fraud) accordingly: Full of rage, he takes out his rifle and shoots (in good old "Moorhuhn" style) the rabbit, who obviously wants to apply his newly-learned flight skills. But soon after leaving the shaman, he feels remorse and wants to return the money to the shaman. In order to achieve this, he tries to be hit as often as possible - losing a part of the stolen money with every hit.</string>
