    <string name="l84_help_subtitle">
    One day walking along a quiet street, you suddenly get the urge to get rid of
    your gem collection. Luckily the street has plenty of drains, each of them with
    holes in different shapes. In short: Not every gem fits every drain. But even if you choose the correct gem, 
    it will have to be aligned correctly!</string>
    <string name="l84_help_content1">
    You walk towards the right side of the game area. From time to time you pass drains with holes in different
    shapes - you have to find the right gem in your inventory. Therefore, on the left of the screen, you have an overview 
    of your four different gem types that obviously differ in shape.
    </string>    
     <string name="l84_help_content2a">
     Choose the right type of gem by pressing with your finger and the gem\'s shape is displayed at the center of the 
     screen. As long as you hold your finger, you can change the gem\'s orientation. 
     </string>
     <string name="l84_help_content2b">
     As soon as you lift your finger, the gem drops. If you aligned it correctly, the gem will fall into the drain! 
     Remember that it takes the gem a while to reach the ground, so get a feeling for an appropriate drop-off timing!
     </string> 
     <string name="l84_help_content3">
     If you hit, you lose the gem\'s total worth (round gem: $1.000,- eight-sided gem: $2.000,- 
     four-sided gem: $3.000,- and finally diamond: $4.000,-). If the gem breaks (e.g., hitting the wrong 
     drain or the correct drain but misaligned), you lose a tenth of the gem\'s value. Hitting the dusty road doesn\'t 
     destroy the gem - so you won\'t lose anything. 
     </string> 
     <string name="l84_help_content4">
     The game is finished if you reach the end of the road or if you get rid of your whole gem collection
    </string> 
    <string name="l84_help_content5">
     Have fun!
