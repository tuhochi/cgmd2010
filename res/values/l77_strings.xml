<string name="l77_paragraph01">The idea of the game is to move valuable blocks by dragging them in the vertical direction. 
Three blocks in a row cancel each other out. 
Gold is lost to reinstate the value of the blocks!</string>
<string name="l77_paragraph02">Try to cancel as many blocks as possible in one go and you will earn more points by having more Gold taken away.</string>
<string name="l77_paragraph03">If there are more items above the affected blocks they fall down. 
And if you are lucky enough for them to fall next to similar items - you will get bonus points! 
The more chained blocks are cancelled more money you will get.. or loose!</string>
