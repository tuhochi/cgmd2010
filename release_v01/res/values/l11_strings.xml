<string name="l11_help_01">In this level you have to distribute your treasure among people. 
But be beware, most people are very greedy and start fighting each other, when they get too close.</string>
<string name="l11_help_02">Touch the screen at the position at which you want to drop some treasure. The longer you touch the screen, the more treasure you drop. 
All people close to the gold heap start moving towards the heap to collect the gold.
 When one of the pedestrians gets too close to another they start fighting and cannot collect gold during that. You have to prevent that, by sliding with your finger over the screen to push them around  so that they can calmly collect the gold.
