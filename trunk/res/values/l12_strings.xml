<string name="l12_title">Bye Bye, Bonuses!</string>
<string name="l12_paragraph01">All the financial institutes owned by our rich bunny have overcome the crisis and are rolling in cash once again. Of course this means huge bonuses for our bunny. The men carrying suitcases full of money are already on their way to bunny\'s home. Stop them to spare him even bigger wealth!</string>
<string name="l12_paragraph02">In this tower-defense-style level you have to arm bunny\'s front yard to blast those no good money carrying bastards back to where they came from. Spend as much money as possible on modern high-tech home security systems to stop your minions from reaching your doorstep. But beware: they are determined to hand you your hard earned bonuses and they are coming prepared.</string>
<string name="l12_paragraph03">The game is played from a bird\'s eye view. Enemies approach from the left side of the screen and try to reach the door on the right. The lawn in the middle can be equipped with various defense mechanisms that can be selected from the menu. All you have to do is place and maintain those devices, they handle the "rest". The game\'s goal is to stop as many money carriers as possible from reaching your house before the counter is running out.</string>
