	<string name="l20_help_text">Our bunny goes shopping! It has to try to buy the more
	expensive products to spend as much money as possible. Click on a product to
	kick it off the shelf so that it falls directly into the moving shopping cart. 
	If you miss the product it gets lost. 
	Also watch out for slippery floor. The bunny may crash into the warning sign and loose
	precious shopping time. Avoid the signs by clicking on them. 
    Let the shopping begin!
