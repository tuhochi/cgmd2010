    different kinds of gems (4 in total) - each of them different in their styles. You choose a gem by pressing it. 
     But that is not the end of the story: Now the gem is falling towards the drain and you have to align its orientation
     (Therefore you have successfully completed Jedi-training).     
     Rotate your device until the gem fits. Normally the gem is falling slowly, but if you are confident you can
     push the speed (Tap on the screen).
