<string name="l42_HelpActivity_Text1">The huge mass of your treasure and the Signanzeffect led to a transformation of space into a zero-gravity structure where all your possessions form a central compact shape. This central shape has already drawn various smaller objects into orbits.</string>
<string name="l42_HelpActivity_Text2">This central 'Goldplanet' must be damaged as much as possible to decrease the treasures value. The only way to damage the Goldplanet is to push the objects (let's call them satellites) out of their orbits and let them crash into the planet. The player can use directional force pushes to alter the orbits.</string>
<string name="l42_HelpActivity_Text3">A force push is triggered by touching the screen, a longer touch results in a stronger push. A satellite must be hit with the right force at the right place to do maximum damage when it crashes.</string>
<string name="l42_HelpActivity_Text4">The perspective camera can be moved freely on a sphere around the treasure by moving your finger on the screen.</string>
