Place "source" files of your media (images, sounds) here,
so they can be easily edited / modified. Each level should
have its own folder under which sources can be placed.

Examples are:

 * Scalable sources for your textures (SVG, ...)
 * Other editable sources for textures (XCF, PSD, ...)
 * Unedited sound samples
